# "I won first prize, for pushing DevOps too hard!~"

![The Failure Party Trophy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D_wYlm3XkAEt2vo.jpg =250x)

## The Story:

I'm a huge advocate for DevOps, Automation and just improving life for people in general. While Transport Canada (at the time of this post) has been wonderful in it's moves to adopt agility, every transformation has growing pains.

Coming from a background in automation and Project recovery, I'm used to talking to people about fear in their careers being impacted - but what I wasn't used to is a group who would take my messages of improved processess and better quality of life for staff as an attack against their competency.

In the end, my passion for making life easier ended with a group who refused to speak to me for an entire month.

## The Resolution:

Another coworker who had worked in the same stream as the group came and was able to re-open dialogue. They provided a common story that showed adopting DevOps isn't an attack on competency.

## The Lesson (and the reason for the Trophy):

We can't do everything by ourselves - sometimes something as simple as personality can cause incompatibility and miscommunication.
