We are glad to welcome you to our community! As mentioned in our About section, we are a group of people from various departments and trades wishing to bring the DevOps culture in the Government of Canada.

This is an informal initiative done on our own time and it's impressing to see the uptake this group has had over the course of the last few months since its inception. We've slowly been gathering people from all around in the GC and we wish to continue see this group grow in a diverse and inclusive manner.

In order to support this goal, we would like to organize events of various sizes and on different topics to help communicate our passion to even more people and welcome them in our community. As such, any contribution you can make in your spare time, whether small or big, would greatly help make those happen! 

For exemple, we organized a Failure Party last week. The concept was very simple: come share with us a failure you experimented and what you learned through it! It was fun and casual but we also learned a lot from everyone!

DevOps is not just about IT, it really is about changing the way we are working together to bring value to our end users.

Does DevOps intrigue you? Are you already living it? Come and join us! We want to learn from you all and help you spread the word across the whole government!
