## About the League

The GC DevOps League is a grassroot movement that has spawn off of a collective desire to change our ways of working, both from a software development and IT operations practitioners' perspective.

The league is open to anyone interested in working in the open, sharing their lessons learned and helping each other take over the challenges that we all have to deal with, even though we come from various organisations deemed "different".
 We're much more alike than some might want to let you believe.

## Membership

As it is, we do not have a "Membership" process.
This is an open community where everyone can contribute in their own way.
However, we do have a Code of Conduct and we encourage you to read it carefully because we want this community to be inclusive and diverse.

With regards to the "member" status of the GitHub organisation [(more details below)](#github-organisation-and-repositories), they have been created to maintain the documentation and plan events.
If you are interested in having a more active role, please request to be added to the "members" of the organisation.
If you do not have the time to review documentation, merge pull requests, organize events, it's **absolutely fine** and you can simply star the repos that interest you, create issues, participate to discussions or submit "Pull Requests" to suggest changes.

We do not expect everyone to take time off their regular work schedule to do so.
But we collectively benefit from any contribution made, no matter how small it may seem to you as an individual.

## Communications

The GC DevOps League uses various channels of communications.

* [GitHub](#github-organisation-and-repositories)
* GCMessage
* Slack
* Twitter

### GitHub organisation and Repositories

The GitHub "organisation" is a way for us to aggregate information material and documentation in the open.
Individually, we do not know everything and, even as a group, we can benefit from having our discussions in the open.
Other organisations and teams have already gone through the process of changing their practices to be more inclusive and open.
Anyone is welcome to provide us additional insights as we go through our collective journey.

One thing that we have observed is that a lot of the information, guidance and tools available out there seem to be tailored for businesses.
As employees of the federal government, we have a different set of responsibilities towards the citizens and we will most likely have to tailor this external knowledge to the laws and internal rules that we are bound to.
Our work may also be useful to help better adapt our internal rules to the outcomes expected by our citizens in this time and age: becoming a Digital Government providing services of value to them.

Within this "organisation", we have created repositories that aim to address certain topics.
These repositories will change over time as we better see how our community evolves.
Each repository has an "Issues" section where anyone can start a conversation.
These "Issues" are not necessarily problems, but rather discussions topics.
You are welcome to create or participate in an issue for any topic you would like.

## Content

On this website, you will find our work in progress, list of reference material and our presentations.

It's all work in progress and changes continuously and it's meant to make it easily navigable for anyone to see what we're working on.

If you're interested in actually looking at the workspace itself, join us on our [project repository](https://github.com/gcdevops/gcdevops.github.io) on GitHub.
You can create issues, participate in discussions and even contribute!

We've also set up a few CI tests in order to keep our content clean but also to showcase how powerful these open collaboration tools can be to maintain a project, whether it is simple text files or source code.
