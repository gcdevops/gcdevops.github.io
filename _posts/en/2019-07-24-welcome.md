who we are


We are glad to welcome you all to our community! Over the course of the last few months, we've slowly made ways in gathering people from various departments and trade and we wish to continue see this group grow in a diverse and inclusive manner.

DevOps intrigues you or you already live by it? Come and join us! We want to learn from you all and the more we are, the more effective we will be in
